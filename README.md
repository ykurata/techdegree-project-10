## Todo API with Flask


## Project Instructions
This API is versioned, all routes should be prefixed with /api/v1

When the app first starts it will attempt to fetch all Todos in the system.
Handle the request and return all the Todos.

When a Todo is created and the save link is clicked, it will make a request to the server. Handle the request by creating a Todo and setting the proper status code.

When a previously saved Todo is updated and the save link is clicked, it will make a request to the server. Handle the request by updating the existing Todo.

When a previously saved Todo is deleted and the save link is clicked, it will make a request to the server. Handle the deletion and return a blank response and the proper status code.

Unit test the app.
